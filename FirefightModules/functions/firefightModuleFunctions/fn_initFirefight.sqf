/*
 * Garrisons buildings near a given map marker with infantry units of the
 * specified faction. Also spawns up to 5 patrolling groups of the same faction.
 * Garrisoned units will leave their garrison if BLUFOR gets within 25m of the
 * leader of the group. Group max size is 8 for garrisons, 4 for patrols.
 *
 * Random garrisoned units will be able to leave their positions if BLUFOR is
 * within 25 meters.
 *
 * Params:
 * _firefightMarker - string - marker name.
 * _faction - string - facion name from CfgFactions
 * _radius [optional] - integer - Radius to fill buildings in. 150 is default.
 * _level [optional] - string - how heavy the garrison should be. Defaults to full
 *     Options:
 *     light
 *     medium
 *     heavy
 *     full
 *
 * Example:
 * ["firefightMarker", "OPF_G_F"] call s39_fnc_initFirefight;
 * Will fill many buildings with FIA guerillas. When blufor gets close enough
 *
