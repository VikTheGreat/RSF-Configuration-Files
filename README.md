## Weapon Reskins
### What it does
Adds a few Reskins of existing Weapons. Will most likely expanded to include more Weapons and other gear

## Faucon Bleu
### What it does
Adds a new Faction: Faucon Bleu, a Serbian-French themed Paramilitary and Security Force.

## FirefightModules
### What it does
Adds two new sets of modules to the 3DEN editor; Firefight and Shop modules. 

### How it works
Drop a FF Core module somewhere on the map, sync it to a unit, object, or whatever to create an addaction on that synced object(s) to open a skirmish display. Drop one or more FF Location modules in urban-ish areas and sync those to the FF Core module.

You can set custom location names in the location module options, otherwise will default to the nearest named locations name. The UI provides some options as far as opponents, how much opposition there will be, and how big the area enemy spawns will be. Some garrisoned groups will leave their garrison when you get too close, and patrols will actively seek you out if spotted. A simple task will be created, once the area is controlled by you (i.e. few to no enemies remaining) the task will be completed. 

You can clear the active skirmish from within the skirmish UI.

Shop/money modules have been entirely removed at this time.
