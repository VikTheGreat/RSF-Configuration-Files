set mg5 mass to 1 as test     11.20kg = to 24,69177 lb
qbu 88 mass to 2 as test      4.1 kg (9.0 lb) = to 9,03895 lb
rfb mass to 10 as test        8.1 lb (3.7 kg) = 8,1571 lb
stoner 99 is ok

1 mass = 0.05 kg or 0.10 lb
2 mass = 0.09 kg or 0.20lb
10 mass = 0.45kg

IF GIVEN KG VALUE CONVERT TO LB FIRST, THEN TO ARMA 3 MASS (its easier seeing as kg and lb are not 1:1)
